this is a test
Dear All

Thank you for registering for MITS Hackathon. We have received overwhelming response from the student community and got more than double the number we can accommodate. So, we are forced to shortlist teams from the list and take it forward.

As part of this process, we are organising a Micro-Hack at Tagore Library (MITS Central Library) at 3 pm on 13/03/2018 (Tuesday). You will be given a problem statement at 3 pm and given half hour to read and discuss in the team. At 3.30 pm, the team members will be split to different locations and the team should work together online to complete the task. We don't expect a fully functional solution at the end of the Micro-Hack. We will be evaluating the teams based on whatever they have done by 4.30 pm. Our evaluation will centre around the following criteria:
1. Effective team time utilization
2. Choice of tools for development
3. Team work and collaboration
4. Feasibility of solution

The team is expected to have a GitHub account to participate in the Micro-Hack and the main hackathon. Evaluation is based on the following deliverables.

1. Code structure (based on language)
2. Folder hierarchy (if applicable)
3. Judicious use of GitHub
4. Documentation of the code
5. README file that describes the idea
6. Records that describe the collaboration in the team (like chats, excel files, etc.)

You are requested to create the GitHub account for the team today itself and reply to this mail with the link to the GitHub account.

CANTEEN FOOD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CFMS) - SPRECARE
INTRODUCTION
FAO (Food and accommodation organisation) estimated that each year, approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption in the world is lost or wasted. This food wastage represents a missed opportunity to improve global food security , but also to mitigate environmental impacts and resources use from food chains .Indians waste as much food as the whole of United Kingdom consumes â€“ a statistic that may not so much indicative of our love of surfeit, as it is of our population. Still, food wastage is an alarming issue in India. Our street and garbage bins, landfills have sufficient proof to prove it. Weddings, canteens, hotels, social and family functions, households spew out so much food. 
Changes are to be made from the ground level itself. So our group has decided to initiate a canteen food management system which will eradicate wastage of food up to an extent within our limit.
 
WHAT IS SPRECARE?
 
Basic idea of SPRECARE is to eradicate the wastage of food with some technological touch which will make students to contribute into the idea more efficiently. use of programming in an unconventional situation will generate interest among students and the idea will get a push to be presented in different areas.  
The main idea of SPRECARE is to launch a website for the canteen chief/head which he can create an account and evaluate the wastage of food through colours. As we all know identifying a food based on colour and relating it to a programming stream is totally an unconventional situation. This situation will evoke more students to assist SPRECARE.
