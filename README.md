CANTEEN FOOD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CFMS) - SPRECARE
INTRODUCTION
FAO (Food and accommodation organisation) estimated that each year, approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption in the world is lost or wasted. This food wastage represents a missed opportunity to improve global food security , but also to mitigate environmental impacts and resources use from food chains .Indians waste as much food as the whole of United Kingdom consumes â€“ a statistic that may not so much indicative of our love of surfeit, as it is of our population. Still, food wastage is an alarming issue in India. Our street and garbage bins, landfills have sufficient proof to prove it. Weddings, canteens, hotels, social and family functions, households spew out so much food. 
Changes are to be made from the ground level itself. So our group has decided to initiate a canteen food management system which will eradicate wastage of food up to an extent within our limit. 

WHAT IS SPRECARE?

Basic idea of SPRECARE is to eradicate the wastage of food with some technological touch which will make students to contribute into the idea more efficiently. use of programming in an unconventional situation will generate interest among students and the idea will get a push to be presented in different areas.  
The main idea of SPRECARE is to launch a website for the canteen chief/head which he can create an account and evaluate the wastage of food through colours. As we all know identifying a food based on colour and relating it to a programming stream is totally an unconventional situation. This situation will evoke more students to assist SPRECARE.
Wastes are identified using colours.so at first the user will have information about the food and its colour.wastes are analysed by the colour and a report is generated.
